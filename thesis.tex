\chapter{Introduction}

\lettrine{O}{nce} upon a time
% This document was created with the help of a custom class file~\cite{example}. A
% {\em \LaTeX{} class file}\index{\LaTeX{} class file@LaTeX class file} is a file,
% which holds style information for a particular \LaTeX{} class\footnote{You can
% find more about classes at \url{http://www.ctan.org/pkg/clsguide}.}.
% 
% There are some handy options for citing publications. It is possible to print just the year of some publication:~\citeyear{example}. It is also possible to print the name of the author(s) in the form ``Author et al.'': \citeauthor{example}. Finally, there is also a command to print the full list of authors of a publication: \citet*{example}.
% 
% This is an example glossary reference: \GLS{HOL}. \\
 

\chapter{2-adic algorithms for non-linear bit-vector arithmetic}

% Solving Satisfiability of Polynomial Formulas By Sample-Cell Projection:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00409
See that 2-adics are decidable by Dubashi et. al. and that we can use this to
decide non-linear bit-vector arithmetic.


\chapter{Better Model Guided Generalization for Exists Forall in QF\_BV}

Hydra algorithm is naive, find better model guided generalization,
using ideas from virtual substitution for the reals.

\chapter{Ackermannization and Multiplication Abstraction}
Steal from Bitwuzla, mechanize.

\chapter{Reducing Bounded NLIA to QF\_BV}

\chapter{Extending MBA to Inequational Fragment plus Disjunction}

- Unsigned Inequations can be handled using the same idea, see hacker's delight, Ch2.2
- Can disjunction be handled the same way? unclear

\chapter{Multiple-Widths in Width Generic Automataion}

Key idea: If we have widths $x : w$ and $ y : w+k$, note that this really means that
if we are at width $w$, then the high bits of $x$ are zero when treated as a transducer.
So this should allow us to exploit the structure to decide properties.

\chapter{Exponentition, Modulus, and Monus}

See that if we have $2^{w-k}$ and $2^{w - l}$, we really can work in a regime where $w \geq k, w \geq l$,
and just bitblast the case where $w \leq max(k, l)$.
WLOG, $k \geq l$, then we can set $k = l + \delta$, and pick $w' \geq l$.
